######## Mailing Api
create and api end point that accept the following
    title
    body of the Mail
    cover image url 
    receiver
a request to the endpoint should send mail to the receiver
it should be authenticated with request token


######### obscurification Algorithrm

Create an api for obscurification of text.
How it works
A user can make api request to the api 
He will supply the following credentials
    api key
    body of the text (body)
    salt string (str)

Psuedocode

 - The api recieve a call with the following
    apikey, body and str 

    obscurification
step one : reverse the body 
step two : divide it by two: part1 and part2
step three: join part2 and part1
step four: split str into array of five strings
step five: replace every vowel in the body with {{str[index of the vowel]}} while the capital vowel should be {{str[index of the vowel]}}cp
step six: replace every white space with {{}} 
step seven: a call this api returns obscured string (body)

Example
assuming I make api call the api with the following parameters
key: "b5Dup?4de1xpwuiduueyf"
str: "b5Dup?4de1"
body: "come waiting simultanous"

what the function will do
STEP 1 
$body = "suonatlumis gnitiaw emoc"

STEP 2
    part1 = " suonatlumis ";
    part2 = "gnitiaw emoc";

STEP 3 
part2 + part1 = "gnitiaw emoc suonatlumis ";

STEP 4

["b5","Du","p?","4d","e1"]

step 5 & 6
$body = "{{}}s{{e1}}{{4d}}n{{b5}}tl{{e1}}m{{p?}}s{{}}gn{{p?}}t{{p?}}{{b5}}w{{}}{{D{{e1}}}}m{{4d}}c";
return $body;

########## Build another endpoint for reverse the obscurification
